# gengrammar

Generates js code that decides a grammar given a grammar description.
The grammar description can be created through composing function calls or by parsing a string containing a grammar definition.  
 [This is a grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definite_clause_grammar) but in this program DCG have been augmented to use regex syntax in the rules body.
